# Maglev System Tuning Using MATLAB

This MATLAB script is designed to analyze and tune a magnetic levitation (maglev) system. The script includes steps for plotting various system responses, such as the step response, impulse response, pole-zero map, and root locus. Additionally, it demonstrates the design of a PID controller for the maglev system and evaluates its performance.
